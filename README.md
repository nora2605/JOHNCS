# JOHNCS

The amazing parser for the JOHN Notation now comes to C#! Yippee

## Preface

It's bad. If you can, please rewrite it, i doubt the Reflection hell i did there is any good foundation.

But The language itself is good. There's also a Javascript package (using mostly the same code, except way easier because I didn't need to learn the entire fucking javascript type system BECAUSE THERE IS NONE).

Random object parsers are just way easier to make in dynamically typed languages. Not that that's a particularly good thing, but if you have absolutely no flexibility and can't even declare your own types that's like meh.
